# Comparative analysis of Graph Clustering Algorithms


Graph clustering is a way of grouping data by forms of graph in a way that the elements are related by some similarity measure. Graph clustering falls under the category of graph mining algorithms. It has received lot of attention from the research community in the recent years. In this project, we have done a detailed study on graph clustering, the methods by which they are classified, and studied certain algorithms that play a vital role in clustering. We have also implemented some of the popular graph clustering algorithms. These graph clustering algorithms can be used in various fields, including bioinformatics, community detection, computer network analysis, social network analysis etc. Thus, Graph clustering has evolved as a viable approach for modelling complicated patterns in graph-structured data in the recent years.

We analyzed the following algorithms:
1. Minimum Spanning Tree(MST) based clustering algorithm
2. Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering algorithm
3. Markov clustering algorithm
4. Spectral Clustering
5. Shared Nearest Neighbor(SNN) Clustering
6. Betweenness Centrality
7. Maximal Clique Enumeration
8. Kernel K-means clustering
